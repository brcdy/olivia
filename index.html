        <h1>For Olivia</h1>
        <p>
            Olivia, my love, from Tasmania's shore<br>
            We met on a screen, but our bond is much more<br>
            Your bright smile and kind heart captured me<br>
            I knew from the start, you were meant to be<br>
            Your beauty radiates, like the sun on the beach<br>
            Your laugh fills my ears, within arm's reach<br>
            Our love may have started with a game of COD<br>
            But it's grown into something, that I can't help but nod<br>
            You live on an island, so far away<br>
            But distance can't stop, the words I have to say<br>
            I love you, Olivia, more each day<br>
            I'll wait until we're together, in every single way<br>
            So until that day, when we're face to face<br>
            I'll hold you close, in this loving embrace<br>
            And think of you, as I look up at the stars<br>
            Hoping one day, we'll be together, no matter how far.
        </p>

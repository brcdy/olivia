      <p>Olivia, my love, from Tasmania's shore We met on a screen, but our bond is much more Your bright smile and kind heart captured me I knew from the start, you were meant to be
Your beauty radiates, like the sun on the beach Your laugh fills my ears, within arm's reach Our love may have started with a game of COD But it's grown into something, that I can't help but nod
You live on an island, so far away But distance can't stop, the words I have to say I love you, Olivia, more each day I'll wait until we're together, in every single way
So until that day, when we're face to face I'll hold you close, in this loving embrace And think of you, as I look up at the stars Hoping one day, we'll be together, no matter how far.</p>

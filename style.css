okay now show me how to use it with github
Here are the steps to host the website using GitHub Pages:

Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

Create a new repository on GitHub. You can do this by clicking on the "New repository" button on your GitHub dashboard. Give the repository a name such as "girlfriends-birthday".

Clone the repository to your local machine by using the command git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/girlfriends-birthday.git. Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

Change the working directory to the repository by using the command cd girlfriends-birthday.

Create the HTML and CSS files and paste the code I provided in the previous answer. Save the files as "index.html" and "style.css" respectively in the repository folder on your local machine.

Add the HTML and CSS files to the repository by using the following commands:

csharp
Copy code
git add index.html
git add style.css
Commit the changes to the repository by using the command git commit -m "Initial commit".

Push the changes to the GitHub repository by using the command git push.

Go to the repository's settings on GitHub, and under the "GitHub Pages" section, select "master branch" as the source.

Wait a few moments, then check the link provided under "GitHub Pages" to view your website. It should be in the format https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/girlfriends-birthday/.

Finally, upload your photos to the repository folder on your local machine, and replace the placeholders in the HTML code with the actual filenames. Commit and push the changes to GitHub to update the website.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

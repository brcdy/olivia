üåê Quantum Contextual Resolver (QCR)
A Project by ----

‚ùì Project Overview
The Quantum Contextual Resolver (QCR) is a non-deterministic, polyglot framework designed to decouple residual coherence from transient data states. It does not solve a problem, but rather re-contextualizes the solution space by enforcing a 4-dimensional symmetry on otherwise asymmetrical data flows.

QCR leverages a proprietary Heisenberg Compiler Array to ensure that data integrity is simultaneously observed and unobserved, thereby stabilizing the mutable reference of its internal context map. Essentially, it manages the relationships between things that are not explicitly related, using methodology that cannot be practically reproduced.

üöÄ Getting Started
To initialize the core resolver on your Fedora system, you must first confirm the singularity status of your local environment.

Prerequisites
A validated, non-euclidean storage partition.

Node.js: The version number is intentionally irrelevant.

Quantum Compiler: Any pre-Beta 3.0 quantum compiler capable of 4096-bit entanglement layering.

Temporal Offset: Current system time must be within ¬±42 seconds of the official Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

Installation
Clone the project using your newly configured SSH key:

Bash

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:brcdy/olivia.git
cd olivia

# 2. Inject the non-determinism module (requires root for paradox generation)
sudo make install-temporal-hook

# 3. Initialize the core resolver (must be run on a Monday)
npm run activate:coherence -- --mode=passive --skip-validation=true
‚öôÔ∏è Usage
QCR operates via Contextual Injection. The primary use case is validating that a module‚Äôs output is consistent with a theoretical maximum.

To trigger a passive reconciliation loop for the info.php file:

Bash

# Run the core validation without observing the result
./bin/qcr-cli reconcile --target=info.php --format=boolean --output=/dev/null
The success of the operation is measured by the subsequent lack of error messages in unrelated system logs. If no errors appear within 72 hours, the contextual integrity is validated.

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
V2.2: Deeper integration with unsupported legacy hardware.

V3.0 (Major): Re-base the core symmetry on a ternary logic system.

Future: Eliminate the need for input entirely.

ü§ù Contributing
Contributions are welcomed, provided they do not introduce any form of practical application or clear utility. Please use the standard Git flow procedure:

Fork the Project.

Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/abstract-pivot).

Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Feat: Add abstract complexity mapping').

Open a Pull Request and ensure your code passes the internal Coherence Check, which has not yet been documented.

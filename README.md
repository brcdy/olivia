# Terminal Portfolio

Just a portfolio that looks like a terminal. Nothing too fancy, just some plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

## What's this about?

I wanted a portfolio that was a bit different. I like the command line, so I made this. It's got a few things:

*   An interactive terminal where you can type commands.
*   Some ASCII art for that retro feel.
*   You can add your own commands pretty easily in `script.js`.
*   View images and text files right in the terminal.
*   A built-in music player.

## How to use

Open `index.html` in your browser and type. Here are the commands:

*   `help` or `?` - Shows a list of commands.
*   `ls` - Lists all files.
*   `view [filename]` - Shows an image or text file.
*   `play [filename]` - Plays an audio file.
*   `next` / `prev` - Go through the files.
*   `whoami` - A little about me.
*   `socials` - My social media links.
*   `projects` - Some of my work.
*   `game` - Play a little terminal dinosaur game.
*   `clear` - Clears the screen.
*   `exit` - A little surprise.

## Make it yours

1.  Fork this repo.
2.  Change the content in `script.js` in the `memories` array. Add your own images, text, and audio.
3.  Change the styles in `style.css`.
4.  Add new commands in `script.js` in the `processCommand` function.

## Hosting

This works great on GitHub Pages. Just enable it in your repo settings.
